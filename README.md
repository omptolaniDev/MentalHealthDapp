## 🧠 Mental Health DApp

A decentralized mental health records application built with **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **IPFS (Pinata)**. It supports **role-based login** for Patients, Therapists, and Admins. Data is stored securely using IPFS, while access is controlled via Ethereum wallet authentication.

### 🧪 Test Locally

Make sure:

* MetaMask is installed
* You’re connected to the correct network (e.g., Sepolia)
* Your wallet is added for appropriate roles (admin adds therapist)

---

### 🚀 Deployment (Vercel Recommended)

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com)
2. Import Git repo
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy!

If backend is separate, use [Render](https://render.com), [Railway](https://railway.app), or Heroku.

### 🔐 Security Notes

* Patient data is stored via IPFS; metadata stored in MongoDB
* Only authorized wallets (approved by Admin) can access sensitive therapist routes
* JWT-based secure file uploads

### ✅ Todos Post-Deployment

* [ ] Add dark mode?
* [ ] Improve IPFS gateway display
* [ ] Enhance Admin analytics (chart of severity stats)
* [ ] Push onchain hashes to smart contract (future idea)
